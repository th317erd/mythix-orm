/// `NUMERIC` type.
/// Also known as `NUMBER`, or `DECIMAL` in some databases.
///
/// This represents a "real" number of high precision and
/// accuracy in the underlying database driver. Unlike the
/// <see>RealType</see>, which suffers from precision and
/// rounding errors, this will be precise to very large
/// and very small values in most databases.
///
/// The `precision`, and `scale` arguments are named after
/// PostgreSQL, and need some explaining, as their names do
/// not match their intent very well. `precision` is the total
/// number of digits a number can have. For example, the number
/// 123.456 has a `precision` of `6`, because it contains six
/// digits. The `scale` specifies the number of digits that
/// are desired *after* the decimal place. A scale of `0` would
/// essentially mean that you want an integer (no decimal places),
/// whereas a `scale` of `2` would mean you want two decimal places.
/// It is important to call out that different database drivers
/// may interpret and use these values differently.
///
/// Example:
///   class Numeric extends Model {
///     static fields = {
///       numeric1: Types.NUMERIC(20, 6),
///       numeric2: Types.NUMERIC,
///       numeric3: new Types.NumericType(10, 3),
///     };
///   }

/// See: Type
class NumericType extends Type {
  /// Get the "display" name for this type.
  ///
  /// This method is called from <see>Model.toString</see>
  /// when stringifying the model for representation.
  ///

  ///   This is also an instance method that can be called from
  ///   an instance of the type.
